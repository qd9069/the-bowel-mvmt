# THE-BOWEL-MVMT

## Description

The Bowel Mvmt is an app for users who need to use the restroom but don't know where to find one nearby. By using the app, users will be asked to give permission to the app for their current location. Once allowed, the landing page will then generate a list of nearby restroom with average rating and some icons next to the restroom name. Icons include whether key/code is required to access, changing station is available, and if it is up to ADA standard. Users can read reviews and leave their own by loging in or signing up. If users enjoyed their short stay and would like to visit again, they can simply tap on the save button and the restroom will be added to their collection. Users not only can save restroom they loved, but can also add restroom that is not listed into our database.
